## Introduction
Welcome to the CT_Engine repository! The primary goal behind CT_Engine is to create a robust rendering engine leveraging the power of the Vulkan API. By embarking on this project, I aim to delve deep into the intricacies of Vulkan and understand the nitty-gritty details that go into rendering high-quality 3D graphics. Whether you're here to learn, correct, contribute, or just admire the effort, I'm thrilled to have you on board!
